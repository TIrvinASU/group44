# Sun Devil's Pizza

For CSE360, we decided to make a program that simulates software that might run in a pizza store that serves ASU students.

# To run it
We used IntelliJ and we believe that the grader might most likely be unwilling to download IntelliJ. As such, we have made a jar that the grader may use for grading.

For this assignment, we have to validate the user's ASU id by comparing it with a list of all ASU ids.
This is the list of acceptable ASU ids: noeln, tirvin, dhruv, sexyboi
Any other ASU id will be rejected.
Obviously, in production, all ASU ids will be acceptable.
