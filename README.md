# Sun Devil's Pizza

For CSE360, we decided to make a program that simulates software that might run in a pizza store that serves ASU students.

# To run it
We used IntelliJ and we believe that the grader might most likely be unwilling to download IntelliJ. As such, we have made a jar that the grader may use for grading.
